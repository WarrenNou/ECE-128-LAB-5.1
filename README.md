*Please bring your Prelab before you come to the lab class. Each group will submit only one report. 
*Your report is due before the next Lab. If you miss the demonstration during Lab, please set up an appointment with your TA or make a demonstration video and post the link in your report. 

Problem:
Design an experiment which can detect a 4-bit number if it is multiple of 3 or 2. If it is multiple of 3, it will turn on LED1, if it is multiple of multiple of 2 it will turn on LED2 and if it satisfies both of the conditions, both of the LEDs will be on. 

Draw the level -0 block diagram. 
Write a Verilog code for the above design.
Program the module on a FPGA board with proper pin assignments. Analyze the result with a proper screenshot of a programmed board with any I/O scenario. 
Write a testbench for the above design. Simulate it and analyze the result with a proper simulation screenshot.
Show your demonstration to lab TA.
Write a report following the Lab report writing format. Create an account in Github and upload your code with a proper ReadMe file and share the link.
